# Client Report - What is in a name? 
__Course CSE 250__
__Isabel Aranguren__

## Elevator pitch

_A SHORT (4-5 SENTENCES) PARAGRAPH THAT `SUMMARIZES` THE WORK REQUESTED INCLUDING THE TOP RESULTS._

_A Client has requested this analysis and  this is your one shot of  what you would say to your boss in a 2min elevator ride before he takes your report and hands it to the client._

### How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?

#### COPY PASTE GRAND QUESTION 1 FROM THE PROJECT
###### Add details here to answer the question but `NOT` like an assignment Q&A. You need to write your answers as a consulting solution report. A Client needs to understand the answer, but also needs to understand the decisions that went into the answer (when applicable). 

##### TECHNICAL DETAILS

_IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL PROVIDE ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING AS APPROPRIATE FOR EACH GRAND QUESTION_
` `
- _PROVIDE CHARTS THAT HELP ADDRESS THE GRAND QUESTIONS._
![](CHART.png)

Note: Save your chart `.png` file in the same folder as your `.md`. Use the \!\[]\(CHART.png) code above and replace the name to match your png file name.
` `
- _PROVIDE TABLES THAT HELP ADDRESS THE GRAND QUESTIONS._
```python 
s = pd.Series(["elk", "pig", "dog", "quetzal"], name="animal")
print(s.to_markdown()
```
|    | animal   |
|---:|:---------|
|  0 | elk      |
|  1 | pig      |
|  2 | dog      |
|  3 | quetzal  |
` `
Note: Leave one empty row after pasting a chart or it can shift your chart and text. Also `don't` put this | `OR BAR` output into a code snippet it will not convert it to the good looking table in the preview window.
` `
- _YOU SHOULD INCLUDE SMALL CODE SNIPPETS FOR CHARTS, TABLES, AND TO  HIGHLIGHT DECISIONS (SEE EXAMPLES ABOVE). EXAMPLES WOULD INCLUDE CALCULATIONS, AND FEATURES SELECTION FOR ML MODELS._

Note: Python `Snippets` include (3) \`\`\` followed by (3) more \`\`\`, each on their own line. These are not single quotes, they are the key left of the number 1 key on the keyboard. The top row can include the language of code that is pasted inbetween the \`\`\`  marks. 

Note: These also work in `Slack` and it is expected they are used for any code shared in that app. No screen shots allowed.

Note: There are additional parameters that can then be passed after python using a set of {}. Dont put any other text on the row with these marks \`\`\`. See more about these parameters [here](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/code-chunk). We have not been able to sucessfully run python code from in the `.md` file.

Example:
```python {cmd=true matplotlib=true}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3, 4])
plt.show() # show figure
```

Note: If you see a `<p data-line="49" class="sync-line" style="margin:0;">\</p>` its a glitch with the preview add-on. If you use the VS CODE Preview this will not show up. However, use the Markdown Preview Enhanced anyways. 
 
- _YOU SHOULD HAVE QUALITY WRITING THAT DESCRIBES YOUR CHARTS AND TABLES._

- _I HIGHLY RECOMMEND [GRAMMARLY](https://grammarly.com/) TO FIX YOUR SPELLING AND GRAMMAR. WRITING TAKES TIME TO BE CLEAR. SPEND THE TIME TO PRACITCE._
