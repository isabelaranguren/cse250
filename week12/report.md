# Client Report - Project 6: Git your resume online
__Course CSE 250__

## Elevator pitch

Using a template from the BYUI Data Science GitHub Organization, I made a public resume that is hosted on GitHub. In the process of this project, I used the Git process to have others in the class to edit my resumes.


### GRAND QUESTION 1
